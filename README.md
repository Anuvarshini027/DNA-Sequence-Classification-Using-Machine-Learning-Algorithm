# DNA-Sequence-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm

Various Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms are applied on the dataset using in-built package and the code done from scratch for few algorithms.

Machine Learning Algorithms applied on this dataset includes:

## SVM(Linear, RBF,Sigmoid)
## KNN
## Decision Tree
## Random Forest
## Gaussian Model
## Naive Bayes Classifier
## MLP-Multilayer Perceptron
## Adaboost

Kindly download the python file since the cell type has both code and markdown.
